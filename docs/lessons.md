# HexKeyLab Lessons Learned

Hard-won truths that aren't obvious from reading the code. Anti-patterns that burned us. Subtle behaviors that look like bugs but aren't. Read this before debugging anything that smells familiar, and add to it whenever something costs more than 30 minutes to figure out.

## Hardware

### The Lumatone expression jack is wired Roland-style

The expression jack expects the wiper signal on the **ring** of a TRS plug. Korg-style pedals (DS-1H, DS-2H, switch sustain pedals) put the pot between tip and sleeve and leave the ring unconnected. Plugged into the Lumatone, those pedals look like a floating ADC pin — slow capacitive drift downward, mechanical perturbations spiking to rail, no actual position information.

Two pedals with completely different electrical signatures producing identical behavior is the diagnostic tell. Calibration and sensitivity adjustments cannot rescue this — there is no signal on the read pin.

**Working pedals**: Roland DP-10 (with body switch in "Continuous" mode), Roland EV-5, Yamaha FC7 (with Invert Pedal toggle).

### Boards 3 and 4 are physically swapped on Max's unit

Every LTN file, SysEx push, and MIDI map must respect this via `sysexBoardMap = [1,2,3,5,4]`. This is a per-unit hardware quirk, not a firmware feature. If a build is generated with naive `[1,2,3,4,5]` mapping, key colors and remappings appear on the wrong physical boards.

### CC numbers for the pedal jacks are firmware-hardcoded

Sustain jack → CC 64 (binary). Expression jack → CC 4 (continuous). There is **no SysEx command to remap these**. The Editor doesn't expose it because the firmware doesn't support it. Don't waste time looking. HKL adapts by routing CC 4 → continuous damper handler internally.

### The Lumatone expression jack quantizes during calibration mode

While CMD 0x38 calibration is active, the firmware suppresses CC 4 emission and instead emits spontaneous CMD 0x3E status packets every ~100ms. CC 4 only resumes after calibration is exited. UI design: don't try to show "live CC 4" inside the calibration panel; either hide it during calibration or only update outside cal mode.

### Web MIDI in Firefox requires a secure context

`file://` URLs do NOT work in Firefox. localhost or HTTPS only. Chromium permits `file://` for testing. Max develops with both browsers; the deployment target needs to assume Firefox + secure context.

## Tuning math

### r is the fifths axis, NOT the minor-thirds axis

Easy to misremember because the layout is called "Harmonic Table" and minor thirds have a natural place in harmonic tables. The r axis is **fifths** (3:2). Minor thirds are a derived direction (−1, +1) in (q, r). Verified empirically: lattice (0, 1) produces a frequency ratio of 3/2 above A3, i.e., a perfect fifth — not a minor third.

### `reduce()` on large ratios loses precision past 2^53

JS numbers are 64-bit floats; integer precision breaks at 2^53. Several reference intervals (Pythagorean comma 531441/524288) and any compound interval crossing many octaves can hit this. Solution: use the exact prime exponent vector `e = [e2, e3, e5, e7]` returned by `reduce()` rather than dividing num/den. Trial-dividing num/den silently produces wrong results.

### Octave-multiple naming uses ET-style ordinals when commas are absent

Pure octave multiples (no reference interval, no commas) render as "perfect octave" / "perfect 15th" / "perfect 22nd" etc., matching ET conventions. Compound forms with commas like "2 octaves − syntonic comma" use `octStr` instead. Don't unify these — they reflect different musical situations.

### Equal mode interval naming must use letter distance, not lattice displacement

`equalIntervalName()` computes intervals from actual `noteName() + keyOctave()`, NOT from raw lattice displacement `(2·dq + 4·dr)`. Band structure means lattice displacement and letter distance can diverge in Equal mode (where the band concept doesn't apply). Use the letter-distance path or you'll mislabel d2 vs A1 etc.

### Equal mode "rational interval" coloring uses `semis % 12`, not the ratio

In Equal mode, only octave-equivalent intervals are rational (unisons, octaves, and their enharmonic spellings: d2, A7, dd3, AA6, …). The check is `semis % 12 === 0` — green if true, red otherwise. The ratio-based TH coloring used in 5/7-limit doesn't apply because every other ET interval is irrational.

## Audio engine

### `commitRampSync` must integrate in-flight ramps before starting new ones

Rapid `sRampFreq` calls (e.g., during fast transposition) will race if the new ramp doesn't first integrate the in-flight ramp's current position into the source anchors. Symptom: voices snap back to old frequencies mid-ramp. Solution: `pendingRamp` identity check; cancel stale re-anchors; position-based wrap check.

### Wrap-aligned segment switching: never use `source.loop = true`

In v0.8 we unified all sample wraps via `scheduleSegmentSwitch`. Native looping is removed because it doesn't compose with crossfade scheduling, ramp races, and the validStartsByEnd graph. If you find yourself wanting `loop = true`, you're solving the wrong problem.

### Polyphonic aftertouch handover needs velocity anchoring

When the first AT message arrives for a voice, you can't just snap voiceGain to the AT value — you'd discontinuously change loudness mid-note. Solution: store the velocity-implied initial gain at note-on, ramp from current gain to AT-implied target with `AFTERTOUCH_RAMP_S` smoothing.

### Sustain re-articulation requires explicit noteOff

Striking a key that's currently sustained (held only by the pedal) needs `noteOff(key)` to stop the old voice cleanly, then create a fresh voice with the new velocity. Without the explicit noteOff, the old voice continues indefinitely. The flash (`triggerRearticulateFlash` / `rearticulateFlashUntil`) is the visual confirmation that re-articulation happened.

### `ampStepDev` is orthogonal to `xfadeDev`

In the analyzer, two loop points can be phase-coherent (low `xfadeDev`) but volume-mismatched (high `ampStepDev`). Trombone is the canonical case — vibrato keeps phase reasonably aligned but envelope drifts. Both gates must pass to admit an edge in the validStartsByEnd graph. Thresholds: 0.08 for trombone, 0.15 for reed_organ, 0.25 default.

## Rendering

### Seam endpoints must snap to outline vertices

`snapVtx(px, py)` searches for the nearest outline vertex within 6 pixels. Use vertex search only — no segment projections, no flanking-hex logic. The simpler approach is correct here; cleverness produces visual artifacts at corners.

### `Math.floor` boundaries need a +0.5 offset for symmetric animation

`pairOf(r) = floor((r − septimalShift + 3.5) / 6)` — the +3.5 is not arbitrary. Without it, hex centers can sit on floor boundaries and animation timing becomes asymmetric (some hexes animate one frame ahead of their visual neighbors).

### Selection highlights live outside the offscreen build

Hex/text canvases are rebuilt on dirty flags (layout extent, septimal shift, note name visibility). Selection state is per-frame because it changes constantly. Don't try to bake selections into the offscreen canvases — the rebuild cost will dominate.

### Layout switches are zero-cost via offset change

The offscreen canvases are built at fixed reference (0, 0) with padding covering all layout travel distances. Layout switches just change the blit offset; no rebuild. If you find yourself dirtying the offscreen on layout switch, you've broken this invariant.

## CSS / DOM

### Class sharing across handler types is a footgun

`querySelectorAll('.tpab')` matched both transpose AND seam-shift buttons because both used `.tpab` for styling. Seam-shift buttons lacked `data-dq/data-dr`, so the transpose handler hit `+undefined = NaN`, then `keyFreq(NaN) = NaN`, then `setValueAtTime(NaN, …)` threw. Symptom was a vague audio breakage on seam shift.

**Rule**: when a handler depends on specific attributes, qualify selectors with attribute filters: `.tpab[data-dq]`. Don't rely on the class alone if other elements share it for styling.

### `:has()` is fine to use; we already do

`.ctrls label:has(input){cursor:pointer}` is in the existing CSS. Browser support is universal as of 2024. Don't waste time avoiding it.

---

## SysEx / MIDI plumbing

### CMD 0x3E packets are spontaneous, not ACK responses

Calibration packets from the Lumatone are NOT replies to a sent message; they're emitted automatically every ~100ms while calibration mode is active. The standard ACK-matching logic in `sysexHandleResponse` will silently drop them because there's no waiting message to match against. Route them separately from `handleMidiMessage` BEFORE calling `sysexHandleResponse`.

### `pushSilent` flag separates UI-affecting pushes from control-path pushes

Color sync should show progress in the status badge. Firmware queries and calibration commands shouldn't. Both share the queue infrastructure. The `pushSilent` flag toggles UI updates without forking the queue. When adding a new control-path command, set `pushSilent = true`.

### In-flight messages finish naturally on queue swap

When a new sync starts mid-push, the in-flight message is NOT cancelled. It finishes, ACKs, then the new queue takes over. The `predicted` snapshot folds the in-flight message's intended state into the diff so the new queue accounts for it. Don't try to abort the in-flight message — that creates ACK/timeout races.

## Process / workflow

### Stop and ask when hitting circular reasoning

If a problem keeps not yielding to attempts, stop guessing and ask. Examples that should have triggered earlier asks: the descending-once-per-second pedal behavior (turned out to be hardware wiring, not firmware), the band/region distinction in 7-limit (turned out to need careful reading of LTN files). Cheap ask, expensive guess.

### Run `node -e "new Function(scriptContent)"` before presenting JS changes

Catches syntax errors before Max sees a broken file. Costs nothing, prevents an avoidable round-trip.

### View files before editing them with `str_replace`

If view output is older than the most recent edit, the line numbers and context strings are stale and `str_replace` will fail or, worse, succeed in the wrong place. Re-view between edits to the same file.

### Design before code on complex features

For anything touching the audio engine, sample loop logic, SysEx state machines, or coordinate systems: propose the design first. Simple tweaks can be implemented directly. The cost of reverting a wrong implementation is much higher than the cost of a design discussion.

### Refactor, don't rewrite

The code inside the single-file structure mostly works. The audio engine especially has subtle, well-tested behavior (segment switching, ramp races, sustain semantics) that's expensive to reproduce. Move it into modules, add types, but don't redesign it. Mixing mechanical refactor with internal redesign is the standard rewrite-doom failure mode.

## Architectural decisions (historical)

These are settled choices that shouldn't be re-litigated without a strong new reason. They're recorded here so that future sessions don't waste cycles re-evaluating them.

### Single static Lumatone mapping; HKL interprets layout in software

**Old approach** (deprecated): three LTN files (`5_limit_natural.ltn`, `5_limit_flat.ltn`, `5_limit_sharp.ltn`) each encoding a different MIDI mapping for the same physical keys, plus a shared SCL/KBM tuning loaded into Surge XT. Layout switches required swapping the LTN file in the Lumatone Editor; tuning lived externally in Surge.

**Current approach**: one static LTN file configures the Lumatone with a fixed (channel, note) address per physical key. HKL receives MIDI from the Lumatone, maps the address to a lattice position based on the current layout, computes the frequency from the active tuning system, and renders audio directly. Layout switching is pure software state in HKL.

**Why we changed it**:
- Layout switching at the Editor level was a workflow break — physical interaction with a laptop mid-session
- Tuning and layout were coupled across two tools (Lumatone Editor + Surge), creating sync hazards
- The SCL format couldn't represent 7-limit's full pitch space (118 unique pitches > 79-note SCL ceiling), forcing compromises
- Once HKL had its own audio engine, going through an external synth was redundant signal path
- One static Lumatone configuration is one less thing to keep in sync across machines

**Implications for new code**:
- HKL is the synth. Don't add code paths assuming an external synth will receive MIDI.
- The fixed MIDI layout is the only Lumatone addressing scheme. Don't add per-layout MIDI mappings.
- Tuning math runs at HKL runtime, not at LTN-build time.
